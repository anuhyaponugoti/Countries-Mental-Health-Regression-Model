# Countries-Mental-Health-Regression-Model

In Fall 2021, my group members and I collected and wrangled data from credible sources and built a multiple linear regression model in SAS that predicts a country's suicide rate (per 100,000 people) based on characteristics of the country in order to raise awareness about mental health and suicide. We aimed to answer three primary research questions about which holistic factors influence the mental health of a population:

1. Do countries that have a higher alcohol consumption rate have higher suicide rates?
2. Do countries whose people have generally less access to the internet have higher suicide rates?
3. Does a country's predominant religion being Christianity or Islam (the world's two largest religions) affect its sucidie rate in a meaningful way?
